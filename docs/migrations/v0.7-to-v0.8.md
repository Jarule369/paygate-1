## Migrating v0.7.x to v0.8.0

PayGate has changed endpoints and models in v0.8.0 to better accommodate multi-tenant uses and unify some models. We know this is a big change, but are working towards operations which allow for lots of users to leverage PayGate in their applications.

### Configuration

The method of configuration for PayGate has changed from environmental variables to [a YAML file](../config.md) which is specified with `-config <filepath>`. Environmental variables are complicated to configure as the number grows and are more complicated to manage than a file.

### Removed models

The `Originator` and `Receiver` models have been removed and replaced with [`Customer`](https://github.com/moov-io/customers/tree/master/docs#customer). The `Depository` model has been removed and replaced with [`Account`](https://github.com/moov-io/customers/tree/master/docs#account). Both of these models are from the [Moov Customers](https://github.com/moov-io/customers) service.

### Refactoring

Multiple packages were refactored from the `/internal/*/` packages into `/pkg/*/`. This allows for extensibility and better separation of concerns for our codebase going forward.
