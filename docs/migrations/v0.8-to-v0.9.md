## Migrating v0.7.x to v0.8.0

<!--
From "v0.7 to v0.8":

PayGate has changed endpoints and models in v0.8.0 to better accommodate multi-tenant uses and unify some models. We know this is a big change, but are working towards operations which allow for lots of users to leverage PayGate in their applications.
