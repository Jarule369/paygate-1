The [US Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank) has multiple locations where we can have ACH files sent to. Some Financial Institutions optimize routing of files to allow processing during the same calendar day or to benefit from physical locality. This is done in part by the ABA routing number prefix. PayGate has long term plans to perform routing optimizations like this, but currently does no such optimization.
